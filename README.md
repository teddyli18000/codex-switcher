## Installation

### Download a Release

The easiest way to install Codex Switcher is from the latest GitHub release:

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/teddyli18000/codex-switcher/releases)

The personal v0.2.21 release provides a Windows x64 NSIS installer for installing
over the existing app. Its assets include the exact source commit and SHA256.
The older `v1` release does not implement the current fork policy.

Choose the file for your platform:

- **macOS Apple Silicon:** `Codex.Switcher_*_aarch64.dmg`
- **macOS Intel:** `Codex.Switcher_*_x64.dmg`
- **Windows:** `Codex.Switcher_*_x64-setup.exe` or `Codex.Switcher_*_x64_en-US.msi`
- **Linux Debian/Ubuntu:** `Codex.Switcher_*_amd64.deb`
- **Linux AppImage:** `Codex.Switcher_*_amd64.AppImage`
- **Linux RPM:** `Codex.Switcher-*-1.x86_64.rpm`

> **macOS:** current release builds are not Apple-notarized. If macOS says the
> app is damaged, move it to `/Applications` and remove the quarantine flag:
>
> ```bash
> sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Codex Switcher.app"
> open "/Applications/Codex Switcher.app"
> ```

### Personal fork behavior

Usage, subscription information, and statistics are fetched only by explicit
refresh actions. Startup, opening the tray, and cache expiry do not fetch data.
Successful results are saved locally for five minutes, so a quick restart keeps
them. The UI shows the last refresh time and hides expired values. Quota reset
boundaries may expire data earlier.

This fork has no updater or telemetry reporting. Download and install updates
manually from this fork. See [the fork policy](docs/FORK_POLICY.md) for the
network contract and upgrade checks.

### Build from Source

#### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/teddyli18000/codex-switcher.git
cd codex-switcher

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in development mode
pnpm tauri dev

# Build for production
pnpm tauri build
```

> **Windows:** the `pnpm tauri` script runs through a POSIX shell wrapper
> (`sh ./scripts/tauri.sh`) and will not work in PowerShell/CMD. Use the
> `tauri:win` script instead: `pnpm tauri:win dev` and `pnpm tauri:win build`.

The built application will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

### Run the Dashboard in a Browser

You can also serve the built dashboard over HTTP instead of opening the Tauri shell.

```bash
# Build the frontend and start the web server on 0.0.0.0:3210
pnpm lan
```

Optional environment variables:

- `CODEX_SWITCHER_WEB_HOST` to override the bind host
- `CODEX_SWITCHER_WEB_PORT` to override the port

The browser dashboard serves the same UI and backend actions through `/api/invoke/*`, which makes it usable over LAN, Tailscale, or a remote host tunnel when you expose the chosen port safely.

## Usage and Reset Credits

Codex Switcher shows two kinds of account usage information:

- **Rate limits** – the account card shows the current 5-hour and weekly limit
  windows, remaining percentage, reset timing, credit balance, and subscription
  expiry when available.
- **Usage Stats** – ChatGPT OAuth accounts can expand the **Usage
  Stats** panel to view stats such as lifetime tokens,
  today, last 7 days, last 30 days, streaks, longest task, token activity,
  reasoning/activity insights, and most-used integrations. The active account
  opens this panel by default; other accounts keep it collapsed until needed.
- **Manual reset credits** – OAuth accounts with available reset credits show a
  compact badge next to the plan badge. It includes the available count and the
  closest expiry date, hides zero-count results, and turns amber within 10 days
  or red within 3 days of expiry.

The tray popup also includes compact active-account stats for today and
the last 7 days, while keeping the normal rate-limit refresh flow separate.

## Safe Account Switching

ChatGPT can replace an OAuth refresh token after using it. Once replaced, the
older token may no longer be accepted. Before Codex Switcher writes another
account to `~/.codex/auth.json`, it now saves the latest tokens from the account
that is currently active. Switching back therefore restores the current session
instead of an older snapshot.

Token refreshes and account switches are serialized so a concurrent refresh
cannot finish late and overwrite the account you just selected. Codex Switcher
also avoids refreshing the active account while Codex or ChatGPT is running;
close the running app before switching accounts.

If an older Codex Switcher version already saved an invalid refresh token, sign
in to that account again or remove and re-add it once. An invalidated token
cannot be recovered locally.

## macOS Dock and Menu Bar Mode

On macOS, Codex Switcher can either stay visible in the Dock or live only in the
menu bar. The first time you close the main window, the app asks which behavior
you want and lets you choose whether to show that prompt again.

You can change the same setting later from the tray popup or from the native
tray menu under **Dock Icon**. If you choose **Menu Bar Only**, the app keeps a
visible tray item so you can always reopen the main window or switch back to
Dock mode.

## Warm-Up

A warm-up sends one minimal request to an account so its current usage window
has activity before you need it.

- **Manual** – warm up a single or all accounts, from the main window or tray menu.
- **Timed** – pick specific times of day (e.g. `08:00`, `13:00`, `18:00`) from
  the **Timed** control in the main window. At each time the app warms all
  accounts (skipping any whose valid cache shows exhausted weekly quota), so you control when
  your 5-hour windows start instead of letting them drift.

Timed warm-up checks the schedule every 30 seconds, runs each configured minute
only once per day, and skips missed times if the machine was asleep instead of
warming accounts late. It is an application-owned schedule: quitting the app
stops it. It never installs an operating-system scheduled task or service.
Warm-up works without a usage cache and does not fetch usage automatically.

On macOS you can keep the machine awake with the built-in `caffeinate` command,
which stops automatically when the app quits:

```bash
caffeinate -i -w "$(pgrep -x 'Codex Switcher')"
```

## Versioning

Use the version bump helper to keep app versions in sync across Tauri, Cargo, and the frontend.

```bash
# Exact version
pnpm version:bump 0.2.1

# Semver bumps
pnpm version:patch
pnpm version:minor
pnpm version:major

# Prepare a release commit and tag
# This prompts for a short release note and runs the version bump first.
pnpm release patch

# Prepare and push a release
# The tag stores the release note for the in-app update prompt.
pnpm release patch -- --push

# For non-interactive use, pass the note explicitly.
pnpm release patch -- --push --note "Fixed account switching issues"
```
